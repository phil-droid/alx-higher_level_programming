JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used primarily for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to add interactivity, dynamic effects, and client-side validation to web pages.

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a variety of purposes, including building web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and server-side applications. It supports a wide range of programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming.

JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is also widely used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js. Additionally, there are many libraries and frameworks built on top of JavaScript that can simplify and accelerate the development of complex applications, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js.
