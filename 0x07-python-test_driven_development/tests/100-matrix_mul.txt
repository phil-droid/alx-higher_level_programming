Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices:
    Read: Matrix multiplication - only Matrix product (two matrices)
    Prototype: def matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
    m_a and m_b must be validated with these requirements in this order
    m_a and m_b must be an list of lists of integers or floats:
    1. if m_a or m_b is not a list: raise a TypeError exception
    with the message m_a must be a list or m_b must be a list
    2. if m_a or m_b is not a list of lists: raise a TypeError
    exception with the message m_a must be a list of lists or
    m_b must be a list of lists
    3. if m_a or m_b is empty (it means: = [] or = [[]]): raise
    a ValueError exception with the message m_a can't be empty
    or m_b can't be empty
    4. if one element of those list of lists is not an integer or
    a float: raise a TypeError exception with the message m_a
    should contain only integers or floats or m_b should
    contain only integers or floats
    5. if m_a or m_b is not a rectangle (all ‘rows’ should be
    of the same size): raise a TypeError exception with the
    message each row of m_a must be of the same size or
    each row of m_b must be of the same size
    6. If m_a and m_b can’t be multiplied: raise a ValueError
    exception with the message m_a and m_b can't be
    multiplied
