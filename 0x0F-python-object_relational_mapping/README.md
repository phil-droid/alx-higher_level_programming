Python Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used to map object-oriented programming concepts to relational database concepts. ORM tools allow developers to define classes in Python that correspond to database tables and to manipulate the data stored in those tables using Python code, without the need to write SQL queries directly.

ORMs provide a high-level abstraction layer between the database and the application, allowing developers to work with database objects using familiar Python constructs such as classes, objects, and methods. Some popular Python ORM frameworks include SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee.
