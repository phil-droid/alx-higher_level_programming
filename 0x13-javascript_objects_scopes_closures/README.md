Object-oriented JavaScript
a style of Object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone. The most popular model of OOP is class-based. But as I mentioned, JavaScript isn't a classed-based langauge â€“ it's is a prototype-based langauge.
